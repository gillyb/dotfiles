dotfiles
==

Install all my apps and configuration settings on a new computer.  
```
$ curl -L https://github.com/gillyb/dotfiles/raw/master/online-install.sh | bash
```

Currently this will install (and configure):  
* chrome
* git (& tig, p4merge)
* node (& npm, yarn, n, webpack)
* zsh (& fzf, fd)
* neovim

Much more will be added soon...


Add support for installing on machine without a graphical user interface
